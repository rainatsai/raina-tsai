            At Hua Nan Securities, I lead the development of digital investment tools and support institutional strategy through market insights on U.S. stocks, ETFs, and bonds.

            Previously at Uber Eats, I completed 3,000+ merchant verifications with a 90% success rate. I've also co-founded two ventures: a 100K-member lifestyle brand and a career community for young professionals.

            I work at the intersection of finance, product, and community. Recharge through drawing, baking, and weightlifting.
