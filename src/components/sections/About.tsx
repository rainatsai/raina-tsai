            I'm Raina, a bilingual product manager with a background in finance and English literature.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            At Hua Nan Securities, I lead the development of digital investment tools like the "e指沖" sub-brokerage trading app and and deliver strategic insights on U.S. stocks, ETFs, and bonds for institutional clients.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I enjoy working where data, design, and strategy meet. Outside of work, you'll find me drawing or lifting weights.
