          <p>
            I'm Raina, a bilingual product manager with a background in finance and English literature. 
            I turn complexity into clarity — whether I'm writing market insights, building digital products, 
            or creating communities from scratch.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I thrive at the intersection of data, storytelling, and user empathy. Based in Taipei, 
            I've worked in fintech, brand marketing, and startup development. I co-founded two ventures 
            and currently manage product strategy at Hua Nan Securities.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When I'm not working, you'll find me drawing, baking, or weightlifting — or sometimes all three.
